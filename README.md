DSAIncarcerationTracker
===

This is a project to help my local DSA chapter track incarcerations in the local jail.

This project will track incarcerations in the local jail from the following sources:

* [bookings](https://apps1.whatcomcounty.us/jaildata/bookings.html)
* [roster](https://apps1.whatcomcounty.us/jaildata/roster.html)
* [releases](https://apps1.whatcomcounty.us/jaildata/releases.html)

The project will then use the Google Sheets api as a storage system/database for this data.
